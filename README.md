DST Photobooth is a photography and photobooth service designed to help clients explore available packages and submit booking requests for their events through a structured and responsive web experience.

## Booking Flow

The booking process follows a simple Django request-response flow:

1. The visitor opens the booking page.
2. Available packages are loaded from the database.
3. The visitor selects a package and enters event details.
4. The form is submitted using `POST`.
5. Django validates the submitted data through `BookingForm`.
6. If the form is valid, the booking is saved to the database.
7. The visitor is redirected to the booking success page.

```text
Booking Page
     ↓
BookingForm
     ↓
Validation
     ↓
Save Booking
     ↓
Redirect
     ↓
Booking Success Page
```

---

## Django Architecture

The project is structured around Django's core application architecture.

### Models

The application uses database models to represent:

- `Package` — stores available photobooth package information.
- `Booking` — stores submitted booking information.

### Forms

The booking form is implemented using Django's `ModelForm`:

```python
class BookingForm(forms.ModelForm):
```

The form connects the HTML booking interface directly to the `Booking` model and provides Django's built-in validation system.

### Views

The application includes views for:

- Home page
- About page
- Booking creation
- Booking success page

The booking view handles both `GET` and `POST` requests.

### URLs

The application uses named Django URL patterns for navigation and redirects.

Example booking routes:

```text
/booking/
/booking/success/
```

> Local development files such as `venv/`, `db.sqlite3`, `secret_key.txt`, Python cache files, and environment files are excluded from version control.

## Data Models

### Package

The `Package` model represents a DST Photobooth package and stores information used to display package options in the booking form.

Package information includes:

- Package name
- Photo count
- Extra photos
- Duration
- Price
- Description

### Booking

The `Booking` model stores the information submitted by a customer.

Booking information includes:

- Customer name
- Phone number
- Email address
- Event type

---

## Responsive Design

The interface was designed with a responsive-first mindset to provide a consistent experience across different screen sizes.

The project includes dedicated responsive styling for:

- Desktop
- Tablet
- Mobile
- Small mobile screens

The visual system focuses on maintaining the same editorial identity while adapting layouts, spacing, typography, and navigation for smaller screens.

---

## Design Direction

The website follows a premium editorial visual direction inspired by luxury print and photography layouts.

### Brand Palette

| Color | Hex |
|---|---|
| Walnut Wood | `#6B4A33` |
| Grey / Taupe | `#A6A39D` |
| Milky White | `#F4EFEA` |

The interface uses a minimal color system with typography, spacing, composition, and subtle motion as the main visual elements.

---

## Security

Sensitive development files are excluded from version control.

The project keeps the Django `SECRET_KEY` outside the source code using a local `secret_key.txt` file, which is excluded through `.gitignore`.

The following local files are also excluded:

```text
venv/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
db.sqlite3
secret_key.txt
.env
```

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/dst-photobooth.git
cd dst-photobooth
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

Windows:

```powershell
python -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the virtual environment

PowerShell:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 4. Install dependencies

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Create your local secret key

Create a file named:

```text
secret_key.txt
```

in the project root.

Generate a new Django secret key with:

```powershell
python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
```

Copy the generated key into `secret_key.txt`.

> Never commit `secret_key.txt` to GitHub.

### 6. Apply migrations

```powershell
python manage.py migrate
```

### 7. Create an admin account

```powershell
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 8. Run the development server

```powershell
python manage.py runserver
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

---

## Admin Dashboard

Django's built-in admin interface is used to manage application data.

After creating a superuser, access:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
```

From the admin dashboard, authorized administrators can manage packages and booking records.
